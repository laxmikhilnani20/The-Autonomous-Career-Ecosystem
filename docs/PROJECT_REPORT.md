## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Challenges in Career Development

**Lack of Personalized Guidance**: Traditional career advice is generic and doesn't account for individual skill levels, experience, or specific career goals. Job seekers often struggle to understand exactly what skills they need to acquire to reach their desired positions.

**Fragmented Tools**: Professionals must use multiple disconnected platforms - resume builders, skill assessment tools, learning platforms, and job boards - creating a disjointed experience with no cohesive progress tracking.

**Unclear Career Paths**: Many professionals, especially mid-career switchers, lack visibility into the concrete steps needed to transition from their current role to their target position. The gap between "where I am" and "where I want to be" remains unclear.

**Resume Analysis Gap**: While resume builders exist, few platforms offer AI-powered analysis that identifies skill gaps, suggests improvements, and provides actionable career development plans based on resume content.

**Progress Tracking Difficulty**: Existing platforms don't provide visual, engaging ways to track career growth over time, making it hard to stay motivated during long-term career development journeys.

### 2.2 Statistical Evidence

- 70% of professionals feel uncertain about their career progression path
- 65% report difficulty identifying specific skills needed for advancement
- Traditional career counseling costs $100-300 per session, limiting accessibility
- Average time to create career development plan: 10-15 hours manually

## 3. Market Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Existing Solutions and Their Limitations

| Platform Type | Examples | Limitations |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Resume Builders** | Canva, Resume.io | No AI analysis, no skill gap detection, static output only |
| **Job Boards** | LinkedIn, Indeed | Focus on job matching, minimal career growth guidance |
| **Learning Platforms** | Coursera, Udemy | No personalized roadmaps, overwhelming course options |
| **Career Coaching** | Traditional counselors | Expensive, not scalable, lacks real-time AI insights |

### 3.2 What's Missing in the Market

**1. AI-Powered Personalization at Scale**: No platform combines resume analysis with AI-generated, personalized career roadmaps that adapt to individual profiles.

**2. Visual Progress Tracking**: Existing tools use boring spreadsheets or lists. There's no engaging, gamified approach to career development that maintains user motivation.

**3. Integrated Career Ecosystem**: No single platform integrates resume analysis, skill gap detection, actionable roadmaps, progress tracking, and AI insights in one seamless experience.

**4. Real-time AI Insights**: Current solutions provide static advice. AURA offers dynamic, AI-generated insights that evolve with user progress.

**5. Accessibility**: Premium career services are expensive. Free alternatives lack sophistication and personalization.
